                <p>Poverty
                    In the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the textile mills that were responsible for much of Ahmedabad's wealth faced competition from automation and from domestic specialty looms. Several mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city centre. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.[74]
                    
                    Ahmedabad has made efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993–1994 to 10% in 2011–2012.[74] This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through projects and programs the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, there are challenges that remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. Finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. This has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.[74]
                    In the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households.[74] This project, also known as Parivartan (Change), involved participatory planning in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training).[75] In addition, participating households were granted a minimum de facto tenure of ten years. The project cost a total of ₹ 4,350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed ₹ 600 million, NGOs provided ₹ 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project.[75] Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.[74]

                    This project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most worked out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance.[76] The SNP received the 2006 UNHABITAT Dubai International Award for Best Practice to improve the living Environment.[77] However, concerns remain about the community's responsibility and capacity for the maintenance of the new infrastructure. Additionally, trust was weakened when the AMC demolished two of slums that were upgraded as part of SNP to create recreational parks.[74]</p>
                    <p>Ahmedabad lies at 23.03°N 72.58°E in western India at 53 metres (174 ft) above sea level on the banks of the Sabarmati river, in north-central Gujarat. It covers an area of 505 km2 (195 sq mi).[4][5][6][7] The Sabarmati frequently dried up in the summer, leaving only a small stream of water, and the city is in a sandy and dry area. However, with the execution of the Sabarmati River Front Project and Embankment, the waters from the Narmada river have been diverted to the Sabarmati to keep the river flowing throughout the year, thereby eliminating Ahmedabad's water problems. The steady expansion of the Rann of Kutch threatened to increase desertification around the city area and much of the state; however, the Narmada Canal network is expected to alleviate this problem. Except for the small hills of Thaltej-Jodhpur Tekra, the city is almost flat. Three lakes lie within the city's limits—Kankaria, Vastrapur and Chandola. Kankaria, in the neighbourhood of Maninagar, is an artificial lake developed by the Sultan of Gujarat, Qutb-ud-din, in 1451.[83]

                        According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone 3, in a scale of 2 to 5 (in order of increasing vulnerability to earthquakes).[84]
                        
                        Ahmedabad is divided by the Sabarmati into two physically distinct eastern and western regions. The eastern bank of the river houses the old city, which includes the central town of Bhadra. This part of Ahmedabad is characterised by packed bazaars, the pol system of closely clustered buildings, and numerous places of worship.[85] A Pol (pronounced as pole) is a housing cluster which comprises many families of a particular group, linked by caste, profession, or religion.[86][87] This is a list of Pols in the old walled city[86] of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India. Heritage of these Pols[88] has helped Ahmedabad gain a place in UNESCO's Tentative Lists, in selection criteria II, III and IV.[89] The secretary-general of EuroIndia Centre quoted that if 12000 homes of Ahmedabad are restored they could be very helpful in promoting heritage tourism and its allied businesses.[90] The Art Reverie in Moto Sutharvado is Res Artis center. The first pol in Ahmedabad was named Mahurat Pol.[91] Old city also houses the main railway station, the main post office, and some buildings of the Muzaffarid and British eras. The colonial period saw the expansion of the city to the western side of Sabarmati, facilitated by the construction of Ellis Bridge in 1875 and later the relatively modern Nehru Bridge. The western part of the city houses educational institutions, modern buildings, residential areas, shopping malls, multiplexes and new business districts centred around roads such as Ashram Road, C. G. Road and Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway.[92]</p>

                    The earliest record of the city is in a grant or charter of 812 CE that mentions it as Vadapadraka, a hamlet attached to the town of Ankottaka. In the 10th century Vadapadraka displaced Ankottaka as the urban centre. It seems also to have been known as Chandanavati, named for Raja Chandan of the Dor Rajputs, who wrested it from the Jainas. The city underwent periodic renamings: Varavati, Vatpatraka, Baroda, and, in 1971, Vadodara.

                    <P>The history of Vadodara falls into a Hindu period (until 1297); a period under the Muslim Delhi sultanate (1297–c. 1401); an independent Gujarat sultanate, during which the nucleus of the present city was built (c. 1401–c. 1573); a Mughal Empire period (c. 1573–1734); and a Maratha period, during which it became the capital of the powerful Gaekwar dynasty (1734–1947). In 1802 the British established a residency in the city to conduct relations between the East India Company and the Gaekwars; later the company was also responsible for British relations with all the states of Gujarat and the Kathiawar Peninsula.

                        The long history of Vadodara is reflected in its many palaces, gates, parks, and avenues. It houses the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda (1949) and other educational and cultural institutions, including several museums. The Baroda Museum and Picture Gallery, founded by the Maharaja Gaekwar of Baroda in 1894, formally opened in 1921. The museum displays European paintings, including portraits by British painters George Romney and Sir Joshua Reynolds and by Dutch painter Sir Peter Lely. The museum also contains Hindu illustrations, sculpture, folk art, and ethnography.
                        
                        Among the city’s varied products are cotton textiles and homespun cloth, chemicals, matches, machinery, and furniture. Vadodara is a rail and highway junction and has an airport for domestic flights. Vadodara’s surrounding region extends from the Narmada River (south) to the Mahi River (north). It corresponds roughly to the capital division of the former princely state of Baroda (the Gaekwar dominions). Cash crops are cotton, tobacco, and castor beans. Wheat, pulses, corn (maize), rice, and garden crops are grown for local use and export. Pop. (2001) city, 1,306,227; urban agglom., 1,491,045; (2011) city, 1,670,806; urban agglom., 1,822,221.</P>

The second building is the Picture Gallery, which was constructed in 1908–14 and formally opened in 1921, after World War I. It is connected to the Baroda Museum via a covered bridge. The Picture Gallery displays European paintings, especially English portraits by George Romney and examples from the schools of Joshua Reynolds and Peter Lely. Works by Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and Flemish artists are also included. Both buildings are in the Indo-Saracenic style and were constructed according to local Maratha architecture, which uses wooden framework and brick walls.</P>
                        <P>Throughout its history, India was intermittently disturbed by incursions from beyond its northern mountain wall. Especially important was the coming of Islam, brought from the northwest by Arab, Turkish, Persian, and other raiders beginning early in the 8th century CE. Eventually, some of those raiders stayed; by the 13th century much of the subcontinent was under Muslim rule, and the number of Muslims steadily increased. Only after the arrival of the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498 and the subsequent establishment of European maritime supremacy in the region did India become exposed to major external influences arriving by sea, a process that culminated in the decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption of the subcontinent within the British Empire.</P>

Only after the arrival of the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498 and the subsequent establishment of European maritime supremacy in the region did India become exposed to major external influences arriving by sea, a process that culminated in the decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption of the subcontinent within the British Empire.</P>

                    The earliest record of the city is in a grant or charter of 812 CE that mentions it as Vadapadraka, a hamlet attached to the town of Ankottaka. In the 10th century Vadapadraka displaced Ankottaka as the urban centre. It seems also to have been known as Chandanavati, named for Raja Chandan of the Dor Rajputs, who wrested it from the Jainas. The city underwent periodic renamings: Varavati, Vatpatraka, Baroda, and, in 1971, Vadodara.

                    <P>The history of Vadodara falls into a Hindu period (until 1297); a period under the Muslim Delhi sultanate (1297–c. 1401); an independent Gujarat sultanate, during which the nucleus of the present city was built (c. 1401–c. 1573); a Mughal Empire period (c. 1573–1734); and a Maratha period, during which it became the capital of the powerful Gaekwar dynasty (1734–1947). In 1802 the British established a residency in the city to conduct relations between the East India Company and the Gaekwars; later the company was also responsible for British relations with all the states of Gujarat and the Kathiawar Peninsula.

                        The long history of Vadodara is reflected in its many palaces, gates, parks, and avenues. It houses the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda (1949) and other educational and cultural institutions, including several museums. The Baroda Museum and Picture Gallery, founded by the Maharaja Gaekwar of Baroda in 1894, formally opened in 1921. The museum displays European paintings, including portraits by British painters George Romney and Sir Joshua Reynolds and by Dutch painter Sir Peter Lely. The museum also contains Hindu illustrations, sculpture, folk art, and ethnography.
                        
                        Among the city’s varied products are cotton textiles and homespun cloth, chemicals, matches, machinery, and furniture. Vadodara is a rail and highway junction and has an airport for domestic flights. Vadodara’s surrounding region extends from the Narmada River (south) to the Mahi River (north). It corresponds roughly to the capital division of the former princely state of Baroda (the Gaekwar dominions). Cash crops are cotton, tobacco, and castor beans. Wheat, pulses, corn (maize), rice, and garden crops are grown for local use and export. Pop. (2001) city, 1,306,227; urban agglom., 1,491,045; (2011) city, 1,670,806; urban agglom., 1,822,221.</P>
                        <P>museum and art gallery in Vadodara (Baroda), Gujarat state, India, founded by the maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III of Baroda in 1887. It comprises two buildings. The Baroda Museum, which was completed in 1894, houses a diverse collection that includes Indian miniatures, sculpture, folk art, scientific exhibits, and ethnography. The second building is the Picture Gallery, which was constructed in 1908–14 and formally opened in 1921, after World War I. It is connected to the Baroda Museum via a covered bridge. The Picture Gallery displays European paintings, especially English portraits by George Romney and examples from the schools of Joshua Reynolds and Peter Lely. Works by Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and Flemish artists are also included. Both buildings are in the Indo-Saracenic style and were constructed according to local Maratha architecture, which uses wooden framework and brick walls.</P>
                        <P>Throughout its history, India was intermittently disturbed by incursions from beyond its northern mountain wall. Especially important was the coming of Islam, brought from the northwest by Arab, Turkish, Persian, and other raiders beginning early in the 8th century CE. Eventually, some of those raiders stayed; by the 13th century much of the subcontinent was under Muslim rule, and the number of Muslims steadily increased. Only after the arrival of the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498 and the subsequent establishment of European maritime supremacy in the region did India become exposed to major external influences arriving by sea, a process that culminated in the decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption of the subcontinent within the British Empire.</P>
